<!-- Basic HTML Page Structure -->
<!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta refresh="3000">
    <title>123</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <h1>HEllo world</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!-- DOCTYPE - html version -->
<!-- DOCTYPE - different versions are used to tell browsers to use different renderers strategies -->
<!-- DOCTYPE - If i dont write it - the last version will be used -->
<!-- DOCTYPE - If i dont write ant structure chrome will do it for me -->
<!-- <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" -->
<!-- doctype is case insensetive -->
<!-- different version can prevent using framesets -->

<!-- 
    HTML is ROOT Element
 -->
 <!-- lang="en" is needed for screen reading. without it the default system language is used and it may lead to bad pronaunce -->

 <!-- 
    HTML HEAD Element
 -->
 <!-- consists metadata or external resourses like scripts and styles -->
 <!--  <title>123</title> make titles of web page - Upper in the browser -->
<!-- 
    Can be used followed tags:
    <base> - specified the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. Can be only one base
    The used base URL of a document can be accessed from scripts with document.baseURI. If the document contains no <base> elements, 
    baseURI defaults to location.href.
    If either of the following attributes are specified, 
    this element must come before other elements with attributes whose values are URLs, such as <link>â€™s href attribute.
        BASE ATTRIBUTES:
        href
        target -  display the result when links or forms cause navigation, for <a> or <form> elements without an explicit target attribute. provide differnet browser contexts for loaded resourses
    <link> - href, rel (stylessheets, icons - favicon and homescreen icons), media - load difefrent styles for print and for differnet domensions
            There is also possibility to use crossorgin requrest with link. For example loading fonts:
            <link rel="preload" href="myFont.woff2" as="font"
            type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous">
            BUT it follow cors polisy. anonymous means that it will not send credentialsm, use-credentials values will send creds
            LINK with styles can be used in body but this is bad practice
            Content-Security-Policy can prevent loading favicon

    <meta>
            If the name attribute is set, the meta element provides document-level metadata, applying to the whole page.
            If the http-equiv attribute is set, the meta element is a pragma directive, providing information equivalent to what can be given by a similarly-named HTTP header.
            If the charset attribute is set, the meta element is a charset declaration, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.
            If the itemprop attribute is set, the meta element provides user-defined metadata.
                <noscript>

            http-equiv
                    content-security-policy ( 
                        frame-src (which urls frames can be loaded), 
                        worker-src, 
                        connect-src(Restricts the URLs which can be loaded using script interfaces),
                        font-src(available src for @font-face)
                        script-src(Specifies valid sources for JavaScript.)
                        style-src
                        etc
                        FOR EXAMPLE: ALlow loading resourses only with https:
                        <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src https:">
                        we can also disable plugins here and event report violations via Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only
                    )
            NAMES
            name / content pairs

            author
            description
            keywords
            referrer - HTTP REferer header origin, same-origin, etc
            viewport - width / height (device-width(height))
            initial-scale - ratio between device width / device height and the viewprot
            user-scalable - prevent user to zoom 
    <script>
    <style>
    <title> (required)
    <noscript> - DEFINES HTML to be inserted if script is turned off
