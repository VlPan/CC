// Network (HTTP protocol, HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2.0, HTTPS, HTTP cache policy, REST)

// TODO: HTTP 1 vs HTTP 2
// Request multiplexing
// HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection.
// it allows you to download web files asynchronously from one server

// Header compression by HPACK algorithm

// Binary protocol
// Browsers using HTTP/2 implementation will convert the same text commands into binary before transmitting it over the network.

// HTTP/2 Server Push
// This capability allows the server to send additional cacheable information 
// to the client that isnâ€™t requested but is anticipated in future requests
// The server can prioritize pushed resources
// The client can decline pushed resources to maintain an effective repository of cached resources or disable Server Push entirely.

// TODO: Cachce policy
// Cache-Control:
// no-store - No cache at all
// no-cache - A cache will send the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy.
